# Commerce App / Rails Project

This is my Rails project, Commerce App. This app allows users to request products from merchants. You can also add custom requests to the request to simulate special delivery instructions!

## Usage

After signing up (manually or through Facebook), you'll have the options to browse products, make requests, or view your profile. You can only view, edit, and delete the requests you've made!

## Installation

After you fork this repo, run

```bundle```

to load the dependencies. Then run

```rails db:migrate```

and

```rails db:seed```

to initialize the database and add some dummy data. You'll also probably need to run

```yarn install```

to create the yarn.lock file.  

To start the app, run

```rails s```

and visit localhost:3000 to view it. Enjoy!
